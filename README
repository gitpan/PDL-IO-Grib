Grib.pm allows the user to read files in the grib FORM FM 92-IX
Ext. GRIB into perl PDL - it may not read all possible grib format
combinations.

http://www.wmo.ch/web/www/reports/Guide-binary-2.html

Prerequisites - You need to have the perl PDL module installed.
http://pdl.perl.org

Build and Install:

$ zcat PDL-IO-Grib-xx.tar.gz | tar xf -
$ cd PDL-IO-Grib-xx
$ perl Makefile.pl
$ make 
$ make install



Changes / enhancements you plan to make in the future:

Need to expand the list of possible grib flavors it can read.  
ECMWF, NCEP, and DWD all have slight variations on the theme.
It would be nice if it could write too.
